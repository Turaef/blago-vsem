# Progress: Blago-Vsem Website

## ✅ **Latest Feature: Dynamic Hero Background from Supabase Storage**

The Hero Section now features a dynamic background image system that securely fetches and displays construction images directly from Supabase Storage, maintaining perfect text readability and responsive design across all devices.

## ✅ **Feature Complete: Multi-Page Project Showcase**

The application has evolved from a single-page landing site into a multi-page web application with a comprehensive, database-driven project showcase.

---

### ✅ New Architecture & Features

#### **1. Multi-Page Routing System**
- ✅ **`react-router-dom` Integration**: The project now uses client-side routing.
- ✅ **Home Page (`/`)**: The main landing page.
- ✅ **Projects Page (`/projects`)**: A dedicated page showcasing all projects.
- ✅ **Project Detail Page (`/projects/:id`)**: A dynamic, shareable page for each individual project.

#### **2. "Nashi Proekti" Section (Pinterest-Style)**
- ✅ **Masonry Grid Layout**: `ProjectsPage` uses `react-masonry-css` for a dynamic, multi-column grid.
- ✅ **`ProjectCard` Component**: Custom, reusable cards display project cover images with hover effects.
- ✅ **Category Filtering**: Users can filter projects by category.
- ✅ **Infinite Scroll**: "Load More" functionality fetches subsequent pages of projects.

#### **3. Project Detail Pages**
- ✅ **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Pages use the `useProject` hook to get data based on the URL's project ID.
- ✅ **Rich Content Display**: Shows project title, description, key details (location, year), and a full image gallery.

#### **4. Backend and Data Structure**
- ✅ **Structured Database Schema**: New `schema.sql` with `projects` and `project_images` tables.
- ✅ **Typed Data Layer**: New `Project`, `ProjectImage`, and `ProjectDetails` types in `types/index.ts`.
- ✅ **Refactored Data Service**: `projectsService.ts` provides functions to get all projects or a single project by ID.
- ✅ **Specialized React Query Hooks**: `useProjects` (for paginated grid) and `useProject` (for single project detail) provide efficient data fetching and caching.
